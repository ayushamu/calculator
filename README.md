# calculator
A simple and responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Designed with a clean user interface and functional buttons, this project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
